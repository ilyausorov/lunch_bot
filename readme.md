Invite Lunch Bot to your #lunch channel or any channel. You can even have Lunch Bot in multiple channels.
Every morning before 11:30am, people can type '@lunchbot sign up' to get on the lunch list.
At 11:30am, Lunch Bot will randomly match everyone who signed up for lunch into groups of 2. If there's an odd number of people, then there will be one group of 3.
People can also type '@lunchbot take me off' before 11:30am to get off the lunch list, in case they can't make lunch anymore and don't want to be matched up.
Lunch Bot also understands '@lunchbot list', which tells you who signed up for lunch for the current day.
